# iDIA - Final Basic Mobile Project

iDIA consists of three Mikroskil students:

- Kelvin (151110032)
- Chris Shinta (151111640)
- Willy Salim (151110024)

This project is the imitation of Android-based LINE Webtoon using Android Native. **We used APK version 1.9.8 (released on October 24th, 2017) from the start of the development**, because starting from version 2.0.1 (released on December 13th, 2017) or upwards, the app's UI changed significantly. You can grab the APK [here](https://www.apk4fun.com/apk/203827/).

## Libraries used in this project:
* [CarouselView](https://github.com/sayyam/carouselview) - an Android library specialized in providing Carousels.
* [CircleImageView](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView) - an Android library specialized in circle-bordered ImageView.
* [BottomNavigationViewEx](https://github.com/ittianyu/BottomNavigationViewEx) - a customized BottomNavigationView extension.
* [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) - an Android library specialized in image caching.

## Features we've finished so far:
1. Home
2. Daily (Jadwal)
3. Favourites (Favorit) - Recents
4. Search (Pencarian)
5. Genre Filter
6. Comic Details and Chapters
7. Read Chapter

## Fixes:
* Could not find com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.3.3. error
* If Android Studio prompts you to install Build Tools 26.0.1, just simply install it by clicking "Install Build Tools 26.0.1 and sync project" in Messages Gradle Sync
